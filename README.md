# Joannard-and-Sanchez-Cid-2024
Code used for the treatment of 16S rRNA gene, class 1 integron and metagenomic sequences used in the manuscript of Joannard and Sanchez-Cid, 2024

This repertory contains 4 files:
1. Code used for the sequence treatment and analyses of 16S rRNA gene reads
2. Code used for short-read (Illumina MiSeq) and hybrid (Illumina MiSeq + ONT MinION) assembly approaches (assembly, mapping, MAG obtention and annotation)
3. Code used for antibiotic resistance gene screening in non-assembled Illumina reads (metagenomics and class 1 integrons)
4. Code used for mobilome assembly and annotation (plasmid and viral contigs)

Raw sequences are available at the DDBJ repository, BioProject PRJDB17794
